# Vocabulary for Annotating Vocabulary Descriptions (VANN)

This is a copy of VANN, A vocabulary for annotating descriptions of
vocabularies with examples and usage notes
([homepage](http://vocab.org/vann)).

## Why are you hosting a copy of this dataset?

We are hosing the vocabulary, since we could not find it online
anymore.  At the same time, this vocabulary is used in many Linked
Datasets in [YALC](https://github.com/TriplyDB/YALC), so it is
important to have a copy of this vocabulary available.
